# User Search App

## Application Description

This is a web application that allows to search information about users \
by their username through a public API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).

## Functionality
- Users can enter a username in the search input and click the "üîç" button to get information about the found users 
- If you click the "üîç" button and the input is empty, the entire list of users will be shown 
- JSONPlaceholder API does not support partial matching for the username field, so searching is only possible by 
full matching. \
For example, input with value "Bret" will return 1 result for a user with the username Bret
- If no users are found, the message "Users not found" is displayed 
- The application uses a public API to get user data 
- If an error occurs, a corresponding message is displayed to the user
